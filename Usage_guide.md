# Ovarian Cancer Atlas (OvCA) and Single Cell transcriptomics Atlas Integration Pipeline (SCAIP)

This repository contains the code to reproduce SCAIP method used to generate OvCA described in the resource [paper]().
This pipeline allows to integrate complex and very heterogenous cancer derived scRNA-seq data while preserving patients' heterogeneity.  
If just interested in accessing the atlas resource, you reach it via a cellxgene web platform: [CellXGene](https://cellxgene.bioserver.ieo.it)
